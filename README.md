# 19120 Î´-Opioid mechanisms for ADL5747 and ADL5859 effects in mice: analgesia, locomotion, and receptor internalization.

Raja	2003	Anti - allodynic effects of systemic and intrathecal morphine in two models of neuropathic pain in rats	The efficacy of opioids for neuropathic pain remains controversial. We investigated the effects of morphine on mechanical allodynia in two models of neuropathic pain in rats-the spared nerve injury (SNI, tight ligation of tibial and common peroneal nerves) and the spinal nerve ligation (SNL, L5/L6 tight ligation) models. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to mechanical stimuli (VF hair) was measured using the up-down method in hairy and glabrous skin territories of the sural nerve(SNI) or in the mid-plantar paw(SNL). The PWT decreased significantly after SNI in hairy and glabrous skins (p<0.001). Thirty days after the SNI, the threshold in hairy skin (0.33 (0.21, 1.91)g; Median (25%,75% quartiles)) was significantly lower than in glabrous skin (1.85 (0.59, 3.5) g). In blinded experiments, both s.c. morphine (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg at 40 min intervals) and intrathecal (i.t.) morphine (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0 or 10 mug) dose-dependently attenuated mechanical allodynia induced by SNI measured in the hairy skin. The ED50 for the i.t. morphine was 0.66 (95%CI: 0.50-0.89) mug. The anti-allodynic effect of i.t. morphine (1.0 mug) was reversed by naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, i.t. morphine (1 mug) had similar potencies in attenuating SNI-induced mechanical allodynia in glabrous and hairy skins. In SNL rats, PWT decreased significantly from 26 g at baseline to 2.7 (1.47, 3.51) g thirty days after SNL. Intrathecal morphine (30 mug) almost completely reversed the mechanical allodynia induced by SNL. Conclusions: 1) SNI-induced mechanical allodynia was more robust in hairy than in glabrous skin. 2) Systemic and i.t. morphine reverse the SNI-induced mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent fashion. 3) i.t. morphine is also effective in reversing SNL-induced mechanical allodynia. Our results suggest that morphine, especially i.t. morphine, is likely to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain.	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
